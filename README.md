# PlayDate - "Tinder for Pets"

PlayDate is a \"Tinder for Pets\" app that follows the time honored \"x company for y market\" format and facilitates playdates for pets. The app lets pet owners swipe left or right on other pets, licking or skipping them. If two pets both lick each other, then a mutual match is triggered and a chat is created between them. The live chat keeps track of your matches and lets you schedule a fun-filled day.
